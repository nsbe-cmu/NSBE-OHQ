# NSBE-OHQ

## Background:
As it currently stands, there are no set times for office hours held by NSBE tutors for the various subjects that are offered. This is due to the fact that students have variable schedules that make it difficult to set up a persistent time slot. As a result of this, students who are seeking tutoring services often have little to no notice upon the availability of a tutor for their desired topic.

## Problem Statement:
Tutors and students need to effectively communicate their availability to each other in order to increase the effectiveness of the offered tutoring system. 

## Solution:
A solution to this problem is creating a web application that will notify students of a tutorâ€™s availability. Students can register for notifications about a particular class. Similarly, tutors can register their availability for a given time period as well as classes that they are able to assist with.
